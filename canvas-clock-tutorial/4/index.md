Now that our analog clock is done, we won't be needing the digital one any more. You are free to delete it and the related code, or you can just hide it with CSS.

```css
#currentTime {
    display: hidden;
}
```

Although our analog clock is now functional, it's still not very pretty; there are many more things that can be done with it! This is the part where **you** get creative; add your own personal touches to the clock and tell us what you did.

If you need inspiration, there are several "extra credit tutorials" available. Use these mini tutorials and improve your clock further.

 * [Fixing one tiny bug]()
 * [Adding a nice background]()
 * [Adding numbers around the clock]()

Play with your clock to your heart's content, and when you are done, we have a thread where you get to show off your own designs:

{% include flink site="kirupa.com" title="Show off your canvas clocks in this thread!" %}

Or if you are a Git user, fork the the canvas-clock project on GitHub and share your custom designs there:

{% include flink site="github.com" title="GitHub: Kirupa.com/canvas-clock" %}
